# FLoWRTOS on iMX6SX
![code size][codesize-url]

### RTOS
RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) is an operating system that can handle real-time applications by working on tasks according to predetermined deadlines.

### FLoWRTOS
FLoWRTOS is a real-time operating system on embedded systems that is being developed on i.MX6SoloX processors.

### i.MX 6SoloX
i.MX 6SoloX is a processor designed safe for application in IoT (Internet of Things), the first device on the market that utilizes both ARM® ARM Cortex®-A9 and ARM Cortex-M4 cores. Its asymmetric heterogeneous architecture gives users flexibility by enabling single chip solutions that can run sophisticated operating systems. Version of BSP (Board Support Package) on this research is 1.0.1.
